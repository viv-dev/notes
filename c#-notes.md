## Keyword Definitions

This summarises definitions for unusual keywords I encountered while working with c# code that were foreign to me.

- `partial` - a keyword that allows a class, struct, or interface definition to be split between multiple files. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods) for more information

- `internal` - in line with other access modifiers such as `public`, `protected`, `private`, internal only allows access only to files in the same assembly. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/internal) for more information.

- `assembly` is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. They take the form of an executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (.dll). See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/) for more info.
