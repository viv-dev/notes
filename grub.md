## Grub Hacks

A grub menu that is not password protected can allow you to change the grub start up script during the boot process.

By pressing e on the boot option, you can modify the boot script to boot into single user mode, which gives you root access to the machine.

This should be a security flaw addressed in the appropriate environment, but otherwise can be nifty to restore access or check a system that's in a bad state.
